# Fabric

The irony of building a social platform to get people off social platforms isn't lost on us.

But here's the thing: we've all felt that hollow feeling after an hour of mindless scrolling. That nagging sense that while we're more "connected" than ever, we're also lonelier than ever. 

So we're building something different.

## What We're About

Using technology to facilitate real-world connection. Not the superficial kind. Not another dopamine slot machine. Just simple tools that help people find and share genuine experiences.

## The Tech

- React Native + Expo
- Laravel + Vapor
- Machine learning that understands connection isn't about engagement metrics

Every technical decision is filtered through one question: "Will this help people connect in real life?"

## Want to Build With Us?

If you're tired of building features designed to keep people staring at their phones, let's talk.
